This is a audio note to answer the question on A3#3 task 4: 
a) Hoisting is a term used in JavaScript that refers to the behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means that you can use variables and call functions before they are declared in the code. The advantage of hoisting is that it allows you to write your code in a more natural order, increasing readability and making it easier to understand the flow of the program.

b) Default parameters in JavaScript allow you to define default values for function parameters when the arguments are not provided. This helps in writing flexible and robust code because it ensures that your function will always have a default behavior even if some arguments are missing. The advantage of default parameters is that it simplifies the code by eliminating the need for complex if-else statements to handle missing arguments.

c) The spread operator in JavaScript is denoted with three consecutive dots (...) and is used to expand elements of an iterable (like an array or string) into individual elements. When applied to objects, it creates a shallow copy of the object with additional properties. The spread operator is useful in many scenarios, such as merging arrays, creating copies of objects, or passing multiple arguments to a function.

d) Object destructuring in JavaScript allows you to extract properties from an object and assign them to variables. This makes accessing object properties more concise and readable. Object destructuring also allows you to provide default values for the variables in case the object does not have the specified property. It helps in reducing code duplication and makes your code more maintainable by providing a cleaner syntax for extracting and using object properties.
