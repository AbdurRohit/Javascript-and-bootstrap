In JavaScript, we have three types of variable declarations: let, var, and global variables. 

1. let: It allows us to declare variables with block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are defined in. This is useful for preventing variable leaking and conflicts. For example, if we declare a variable inside a loop, it won't be accessible outside of that loop.

2. var: Unlike let, var has function scope. This means that variables declared with var are accessible throughout the whole function, regardless of blocks. However, var can lead to unintended behavior called "hoisting", where a variable is accessible before it's declared.

3. Global Variables: These are declared without using any keyword and can be accessed from anywhere in the program. Be cautious when using global variables, as they can create naming conflicts and make the code difficult to maintain.

Remember, it's generally recommended to use let and const instead of var to improve code clarity and prevent issues caused by hoisting.
