What is variable ?
Ans-> In JavaScript, a variable is a named container that holds a value. It allows you to store and manipulate data within your program. Variables in JavaScript are dynamically typed, which means that they can hold values of any data type, and the type of a variable can change during the execution of the program.

What should be kept in mind while naming a variable: 

Valid characters , Case sensitivity, Descriptive and meaningful names, Camel case, Avoid reserved keywords, Maintain consistency in your naming conventions.

What is a constant?
Ans-> In JavaScript, a constant is a type of variable that cannot be reassigned once it has been defined. It is a way to declare a value that remains constant throughout the execution of a program. Constants are useful when you want to define values that should not be changed or mutated during the program's execution.

How is a constant different from a variable?
Ans-> JavaScript uses constants and variables to store values, but they have distinct characteristics. Constants, declared with const, hold values that cannot be reassigned once defined. They are useful for values that should remain constant throughout the program. Variables, declared with var, let, or const, allow values to be assigned or reassigned during program execution. They provide flexibility to store changing data. Constants must be assigned a value upon declaration and have block scope, while variables can be declared without an initial value, have different scopes (function or block), and var variables are hoisted. Understanding these differences is crucial for effectively managing data in JavaScript programs.

What are primitive data types?
Ans-> In programming, primitive data types are the most basic or fundamental types of data that are built into a programming language. They are typically predefined by the language itself and represent simple values.

Primitive data types are Boolean, String, Number, Symbol, Null, Undefined etc.
