a. Loose equality: In JavaScript, loose equality is denoted by the double equals (`==`) operator. It is a type-coercive comparison, meaning it allows operands of different types to be considered equal after converting them to a common type.

b. Strict equality: Strict equality is denoted by the triple equals (`===`) operator in JavaScript. It performs a non-coercive comparison and checks both value and type. The operands must be of the same type and have the same value to be considered equal.

c. Differences between loose and strict equality:
- Loose equality performs type coercion, which can lead to unexpected results. For example, `1 == "1"` would be true because the string "1" is coerced to a number.
- Strict equality does not perform type coercion, so `1 === "1"` would be false since the types are different.
- Strict equality is generally recommended because it avoids potential bugs caused by unexpected type conversions.

d. Truthy and Falsy values: In JavaScript, values are considered truthy if they coerce to true in a boolean context, and falsy if they coerce to false. Examples of falsy values include `false`, `0`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, and an empty string (`""`). All other values are truthy, including non-empty strings, numbers other than 0, objects, arrays, and functions.

e. Possible falsy values: `false`, `0`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, and `""` (empty string).

f. NOT Operator: The NOT operator (`!`) inverts the truthiness of a value. It returns `true` if the operand is falsy, and `false` if the operand is truthy.
Example: `const value = 0; console.log(!value); // Output: true`

g. AND Operator: The AND operator (`&&`) returns `true` if both operands are truthy, otherwise, it returns `false`.
Example: `const x = true; const y = false; console.log(x && y); // Output: false`

h. OR Operator: The OR operator (`||`) returns `true` if at least one of the operands is truthy, otherwise, it returns `false`.
Example: `const a = false; const b = true; console.log(a || b); // Output: true`

i. Ternary Operator: The ternary operator is a concise way to write conditional expressions in JavaScript. It has the form: `condition ? expr1 : expr2`. If the condition is true, it evaluates `expr1`, otherwise, it evaluates `expr2`.
We use the ternary operator to make code more readable and reduce duplication when we need to choose between two values based on a condition. It helps simplify and streamline conditional operations and assignments.
